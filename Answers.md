#### Discuss the differences among the results. Does the starting point make a difference?

The starting point makes a difference for the first three, but for the random walk, it doesn't matter.  The other ones have to traverse in order, but random walk doesn't.  The other three are very similar because there are only two levels of countries, the center and the surrounding.

#### Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.

Because there would be more depth and more countries touching each other with several layers of countries.  We only use one country and the surrounding, and don't include the ones that surround those surrounding ones, which increases the edges by a lot and makes having 4 colors impossible.  This would be the most obvious in the center of Europe and the USA states.
